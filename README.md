  ♥ The goal of this project is to analyze the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the heart disease
  
  ## Problem Statement 
  ❓ Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical        data for better future preparation
  <br /> ❓ A dataset is formed by taking into consideration some of the information of 297 individuals

  <br />
  <br />
  ➡️ From the  plot it is understood that females are less likely to have heart disease than males
  
  ➡️ We can also see that chances of females getting a heart disease increases between the age of 55 and 65 years
  
  ➡️ And the chances of males getting a heart disease increases above 45 years of age

  # Conclusion
  ### ❗ 46.13% People suffering from heart disease
  ### ❗ The number of males is comparatively higher than the number of females, we may not get accurate results when we are doing gender comparisons with different features
  ### ❗ People having asymptomatic chest pain have a higher chance of heart disease
  ### ❗ High number of cholesterol level in people having heart disease
  ### ❗ People are more prone to heart diseases having fixed defect and reversable defect thalassemia
  ### ❗ Blood pressure 140 or higher indicates that the target individual has heart disease
  ### ❗ Patients having fasting blood sugar >120 mg/dl have higher chances of having heart diseases
  ### ❗ Further study of outliers are needed to make more accurate analysis
